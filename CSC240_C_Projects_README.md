## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) installed.
- Recommended to use a Unix-based system for seamless compilation.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Imonuil12/CSC240-C-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd CSC240-C-Projects
   ```
3. Compile the desired project using the provided Makefile or directly with `gcc`. For example:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   gcc -o project_name project_name.c
   ```
